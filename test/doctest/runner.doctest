Underpinning the RubyDocTest framework is a RubyDocTest::Runner singleton.

	>> require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../../lib/rubydoctest"
	>> runner = RubyDocTest::Runner.instance
	>> runner.class
	=> RubyDocTest::Runner

The Runner parses the contents of *.doctest files under test, specifically it is 
passed a String, in RubyDocTest format (a superset of Markdown format), runs
the inline Ruby code and compares it to any "=> expected" results.

The aggregated results are returned for inspection and display to the user.

The base case is to evaluate an empty string which should not fail.

	>> runner.run ""
